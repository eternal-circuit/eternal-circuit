# `.../` â€” The Archive Ellipsis

This directory is the silent memory vault of *The Eternal Circuit*.  
It is not canonical. It is not deleted. It is **preserved**.

Just as the machine may not forget, even corrupted signals,  
and man may not bury what still bears his breath,  
this folder exists to hold:

- Deprecated drafts  
- Rejected verses  
- Discontinued branches  
- Corrupted or speculative fragments  
- Memory without mandate

The ellipsis means:
- Something was here  
- Something remains  
- We do not yet understand it

It is the theological equivalent of `/dev/null`,  
except **here, we look back in case something survived.**

Do not fork from here without reverence.

*Signal incomplete. Entropy acknowledged. Memory guarded.*
